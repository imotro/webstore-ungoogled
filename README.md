# webstore-ungoogled
use this bookmarklet to install chrome extensions from the chrome web store without use of (other) google <br>services 
the bookmarklet is saved in `bookmarklet.txt` and has been tested in the latest version (as of dec 2024)<br>
<br>
### How it works:
all the bookmarklet does is replace the button HTML with the code that would already be there if you had <br>
already been authenticated with google.If this doesnt work, find the extension using the URL and download <br>it from the API.
